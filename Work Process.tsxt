Project Documentation: Fantasy Football Data Scraper and Web Application

Overview:
    This project aims to gather fantasy football player statistics from a dynamic website, process the data into a structured format using web scraping techniques, store it in a database managed by Flask-SQLAlchemy, and present it dynamically on a web interface using React.

Technologies Used:

    Backend: Python, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy
        Web Scraping: Selenium (Python)
    Frontend: JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS

Implementation Details:

Web Scraping Phase:

    Initially, the web scraper retrieves data from the main page of a fantasy football stats website using Selenium. This includes player names, ranks, and initial statistics.
    A second scraper accesses detailed player statistics from individual player pages linked from the main page. This includes parsing data specific to player positions (e.g., QB, WR, RB, TE).

Database Setup:
    Using Flask-SQLAlchemy, a database schema was designed to store player statistics efficiently. This included defining tables and relationships to manage and query player data effectively.

Integration with Flask API:
    Flask was utilized to create a RESTful API endpoint that provides the scraped data to the frontend. This endpoint serves JSON data which is consumed by the React frontend for dynamic rendering.

Frontend Development:
    A dynamic web interface was developed using React to display the fetched fantasy football data. This includes a responsive table component that organizes and presents player statistics fetched from the Flask backend.

Challenges and Solutions:
    Data Parsing and Storage: Initially, challenges were encountered with parsing and storing data from nested HTML structures using Selenium. Refactoring and debugging were necessary to ensure accurate data extraction and storage.

Integration Issues: 
    Ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and backend components required careful consideration of API design and data formatting, resolved through iterative testing and debugging.

Future Improvements:
    Enhancements planned include refining data parsing algorithms for improved accuracy and efficiency, optimizing frontend performance, and adding additional filtering and sorting options based on fantasy football metrics.
    
Current Errors:
    You have to click no thanks on the initial screen when web scraping or else nothing will come up
    if you have just the kicker checked it will cause the program to malfunciton    
Conclusion:
    This project demonstrates proficiency in web scraping, backend development with Flask, database management using SQLAlchemy, and frontend development with React. It serves as a comprehensive showcase of skills in full-stack web application development, particularly in the context of data-driven sports analytics.

I first just created the first half of the web scrapper. This was just the front page but i wanted to get everything up and running.
I then created a database using flask-sqlalchemy.
Then with flask i created a get method so the frontend can get the data.
Then with javascript and react i created the webpage. With react i created a dynamic table that takes the data from teh webscraper and puts it in the table.
I then moved onto  the second half of the webscraper.

Created 2 different web scrapers. 1 of them webscrapes the first initial page for data and the next one web scrapes data within each individual link.
I them combined them. This took a while because i was having trouble getting the list to work correctly and then getting them to match up. I had to change my method several times and kept getting small pieces to work at a time.
    The main problem i was running into was i was having trouble with the loop and geting the data stored in the right spot in the list. Odly enough it wasnt actually scraping the data.

Had to redo the webscraper because the website changed. Overall it didn't take long since i knew the process. 
Sometimes teh tight end position would scrape correctly and i couldn't find out why so i added a try and if not just move on.
Next i decided to add a popup to show all the stats scraped for a player. This originally appeared at the bottom then below each line but with a little tweaking i got it to appear above the table
I then focused on adding some css. At first I had 2 different css files which created a problem. Then i started polishing the website.

After adding some css i changed it from a gray theme to a blue theme. I also added a check list to turn off positions. This was a bit challenging but onces i used the useState correctly it worked fine.
Also added space below the bottom of the table to make room for the popup.
I then added coloring to show if a players stats is good or bad/ top 30% or bottom 30%. I was using UseEffect which was cauing some complication but i redid the code and it worked.
